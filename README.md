# D I S C L A I M E R :

## THE FILE WAS MADE (and all is in one file) USING TOOLS I COULD ACTUALLY USE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF LEARNING PYTHON,
## SO IT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO ANY `OPTIMAL CLEAN CODE`.

# It's ONLY A DRAFT of my `game for learning Python` where player should guess the percentage of one given number
# from another given number.
# Algorithm of scoring is based on:
# 1) how close was guess (polynomial approximation to the graph I draw myself);
# 2) were random given numbers `hard` to make a guess or no (trigonometric interpolation in MathCad
# to the graph I draw myself).
# The result of each game is writen in an updated txt file.
